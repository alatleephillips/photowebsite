                    <p>For any of my digital photography services, I charge $500 an hour, with different options for minimum times and billing intervals that are detailed below. All photoshoots include high-resolution digital images, personal printing rights, an online interactive gallery, and professional photo editing. This pricing guide is meant to provide initial information and transparency, but I reccomend reaching out via social media or my contact form to get more details, answer questions, and build a custom package.</p>

                                <p>For weddings I charge $500 per hour for a minimum of four hours, although most couples choose between six and eight hours of coverage. Adding an extra photographer is reccomended for most larger weddings and adds a $500 flat fee.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>For most family photos, one hour at $500 is the perfect amount of time to get a great set of photos at one location. During holiday card season in the late fall and winter, I also allow repeat family clients to book 30 minute sessions at $250.</p>

                                <p>For engagement photos, most couples prefer two locations to get two sets of photos, which usually takes 1.5 hours and therefore costs $750. If you want just one set at one location, that usually takes less time and can be billed at the minimum of $500.</p>

                                <p>To keep things more affordable for students, I allow photoshoot billing at a 30 minute minimum for $250 that can also be split by a small group of two to three people. For larger groups or more photos, we can also do a 1 hour session at $500.</p>

                                <p>The best timing for maternity photos is usually a one hour block in the late second trimester, which is $500. Recently, I have also started offering a special 1.5 hour package at $750 that can be divided in half for separate announcement photos!</p>

                                            <p>No photoshoot is officially scheduled until the deposit is received! With weddings I require a 30% deposit at the time of contract signing. The remaining 70% is due one month prior to the event. For all other photoshoots I don't require a contract and ask for a $100 deposit at the time of booking, with the remainder due the day of the shoot. These deposits are non-refundable, but are transferable to another date as long as there is sufficient notice given. For most photoshoots, for example, it's common to adjust the date with bad weather or kids being sick. For all payments, I only accept cash, checks or google wallet.</p>

                                            <p>The number of photos in the final gallery varies with many factors like lighting and crowds, but does generally scale with the length of time of the shoot. Most one hour photoshoots, for example, tend to have 50 to 75 edited photos in the final gallery. Weddings can have more than that per hour, especially if there is a second shooter. For headshots, I usually offer between 5 to 10 edited photos, working with the client to select their favorites. For any photoshoot, I do not offer unedited or "raw" images of edited photos or unselected photos. Like a bad first draft, raw photos are not reflective of the final, artistic product. The process of culling and editing are part of the service package I provide as your photographer.</p>

For locations beyond Southern California, please get in touch so we can coordinate if it's a good fit, although I am usually down for an excuse to explore any new spots. Travel fees usually cover the cost of the extra driving and a night at a hotel nearby if needed. Some of my favorite extended photoshoot spots in California include Big Sur, Joshua Tree, Yosemite, Bishop, and Half Moon Bay, but I have many more on my bucket list!</p>

This will give you the chance to check out the edits and let me know if you have any adjustments your would like made. Delivery for the remaining photos depends slightly on my current editing queue and you are always welcome to ask for updates on gallery timeline. I deliver almost all photos within two months, but weddings especially may take longer in a busy season.</p>

                                            <p>I love integrating film photos into photoshoots, especially weddings! You can add rolls of film to any photoshoot for $125 per roll, which includes a set of prints. You will also get the option to choose your film stock, although I often reccomend a classic black and white roll, especially for weddings. I develop and print my film with the Darkroom Lab in San Clemente, which has about a one month lead time.</p>
